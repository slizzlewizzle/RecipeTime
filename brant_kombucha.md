# Brant's Kombucha Recipe

## Equipment
- 1 gallon glass jar for fermenting
- 1 wide-mouth glass jar for SCOBY formation
- 1 clean, breathable cloth and a rubber band to cover the jars
- 1 wooden spoon for stirring

## Ingredients
- 1 gallon of filtered water
- 8 tea bags (black tea or green tea)
- 1 cup of granulated sugar
- 1 bottle of store-bought raw kombucha (with live cultures)

## Instructions

1. Clean and sanitize the jars: Thoroughly clean and sanitize both the gallon glass jar and the wide-mouth glass jar. Use hot, soapy water to clean the jars, and rinse them thoroughly to remove any soap residue. Then, sanitize the jars by boiling them in water for 10-15 minutes or by rinsing them with a solution of 1 part white vinegar to 3 parts water.

2. Brew tea: Boil 1 gallon of filtered water in a large pot. Turn off the heat and add 8 tea bags. Let steep for 5-10 minutes. Remove the tea bags and add 1 cup of granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Let the tea cool to room temperature.

3. Add starter tea and SCOBY: Pour a bottle of store-bought raw kombucha (with live cultures) into the cooled tea, along with any sediment or "strings" that may be present. Stir well. Transfer the mixture to the wide-mouth glass jar.

4. Cover and let sit: Place the wide-mouth glass jar in a warm, dark spot where it won't be disturbed. Cover the top of the jar with a clean cloth and secure it with a rubber band. Let the tea and kombucha mixture sit undisturbed in a warm, dark place for 1-2 weeks. During this time, a new SCOBY will form on the surface of the liquid.

5. Test the starter liquid: After 1-2 weeks, taste the starter liquid to see if it's tangy and acidic. If it is, it's ready to use as a starter for your kombucha. If it's still too sweet, let it sit for a few more days and test again.

6. Transfer the SCOBY and starter liquid: Once your starter liquid is ready, carefully transfer the SCOBY and 1-2 cups of the starter liquid to the gallon glass jar.

7. Add brewed tea: Add the cooled, brewed tea to the gallon glass jar with the SCOBY and starter liquid. Stir well with a wooden spoon.

8. Cover and let ferment: Cover the jar with a clean cloth and secure it with a rubber band. Let the mixture sit undisturbed in a warm, dark place for 7-10 days to ferment.

9. Test the kombucha: After 7-10 days, you can taste test the kombucha to see if it's done. The longer it ferments, the tangier and more acidic it will become.

10. Bottle the kombucha: Once the kombucha is to your liking, remove the SCOBY and 1-2 cups of the liquid and store it in a clean container. Then, bottle the remaining kombucha in clean, airtight bottles and let them sit at room temperature for an additional 1-2 days to carbonate.
