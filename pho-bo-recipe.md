# Beef Pho (Pho Bo) Recipe

## Ingredients
1. 4 lbs beef bones (preferably a mix of marrow and knuckle bones)
2. 1 lb beef brisket or flank
3. 1 onion, unpeeled and halved
4. 3-4-inch piece of ginger, unpeeled and halved lengthwise
5. 3-4 quarts water
6. 2-3 star anise
7. 1 cinnamon stick
8. 3-4 whole cloves
9. 1 black cardamom pod (optional)
10. 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
11. 1/4 cup fish sauce (adjust to taste)
12. 1 tablespoon sugar
13. Salt, to taste

### For serving
1. 8-10 oz dried rice noodles (banh pho), cooked according to package instructions
2. 1/2 lb beef sirloin or round, thinly sliced across the grain
3. 1 onion, thinly sliced
4. 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
5. 1/4 cup chopped green onions
6. Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and thinly sliced jalapeno peppers for garnish
7. Hoisin sauce and sriracha for condiments

## Instructions

1. **Parboil the bones**: In a large pot, cover the beef bones with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, and boil for 10 minutes. Drain the bones, rinse under cold water, and set aside.

2. **Char the onion and ginger**: Over an open flame or in a broiler, char the onion and ginger halves until they're blackened and fragrant. Set aside.

3. **Toast the spices**: In a dry pan, toast the star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pod (if using), and coriander seeds for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. Place the toasted spices in a spice bag or cheesecloth tied with kitchen twine.

4. **Assemble the broth**: Place the parboiled bones, beef brisket or flank, charred onion and ginger, spice bag, fish sauce, sugar, and enough water to cover everything (about 3-4 quarts) in a large stockpot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Skim any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.

5. **Simmer the broth**: Allow the broth to simmer for at least 2 hours, preferably 4-6 hours for the best flavor. If using brisket or flank, remove it after 1.5-2 hours, or when it's tender. Let it cool, then slice thinly and set aside.

6. **Strain and season the broth**: Once the broth has reached the desired flavor, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot. Discard the solids. Season the broth with additional fish sauce, sugar, and salt, to taste.

7. **Assemble the bowls**: Divide the cooked rice noodles among serving bowls. Top each bowl with a few slices of the cooked brisket or flank, raw thinly sliced beef sirloin or round, sliced onions, chopped cilantro, and green onions.

8. **Serve**: Bring the strained broth to a rolling boil, then ladle it over the ingredients in each bowl. The hot broth will cook the raw beef slices. Serve immediately with Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, jalapeno slices, hoisin sauce, and sriracha on the side, allowing each person to customize their bowl with garnishes and cond
