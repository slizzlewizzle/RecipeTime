## Ingredients

- 8 large flour tortillas
- 4 oz thin rice noodles, cooked and drained
- 1 lb extra-firm tofu, drained, pressed, and cut into thin strips
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil, divided
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp vegetarian fish sauce or additional soy sauce
- 1 cup bean sprouts
- 1 cup thinly sliced bell pepper (any color)
- 1 cup thinly sliced carrots
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped
- 1/4 cup green onions, chopped
- 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced (optional)
- 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
- 1/4 cup sriracha sauce

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until softened.

2. Add the vegetable broth, soy sauce, sugar, and vegetarian fish sauce (or additional soy sauce) to the pot. Bring the broth to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 20 minutes to develop the flavors.

3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Sear the tofu strips for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden and crispy. Set aside.

4. Assemble the phoritto: Lay out a large flour tortilla on a clean surface. Place a portion of cooked rice noodles in the center of the tortilla, then top with a few strips of seared tofu, a handful of bean sprouts, bell pepper slices, and carrot slices. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro, basil, mint, and green onions. Add jalapeño slices, if desired.

5. Drizzle hoisin sauce and sriracha sauce over the filling, according to your preference for spiciness. Be careful not to overfill the tortilla, as it may be difficult to wrap.

6. Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll it up tightly from the bottom to enclose the filling. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.

7. To serve, cut the Veggie Delight Phoritto in half diagonally and enjoy with extra hoisin and sriracha sauce on the side.

The Veggie Delight Phoritto is a flavorful and satisfying vegetarian fusion meal that combines the best elements of Vietnamese and Mexican cuisines. Perfect for a portable lunch or a unique dinner, this dish is sure to delight vegetarians and omnivores alike.
