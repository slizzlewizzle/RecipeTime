# Audrey's Bread Pudding Mini's

## Ingredients:

- 2 cups of leftover bread crust, cut into small cubes
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup raisins (optional)

## Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a mini muffin pan with cooking spray.
2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the milk, heavy cream, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt until well combined.
3. Add the bread crust cubes to the bowl and stir to coat the bread with the liquid mixture. Let it sit for 10 minutes to allow the bread to soak up the liquid.
4. If using raisins, stir them into the bread mixture.
5. Using a spoon or cookie scoop, fill the muffin cups with the bread mixture, pressing down lightly to pack it in.
6. Bake the bread pudding bites for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and set.
7. Let the bread pudding bites cool in the muffin pan for 5 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.
8. Dust the tops of the bread pudding bites with powdered sugar before serving.
