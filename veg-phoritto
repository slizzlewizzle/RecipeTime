# Classic Phoritto Recipe

The Classic Phoritto combines the comforting flavors of Vietnamese pho with the convenience of a Mexican burrito, making it a delicious and portable fusion meal. This recipe features tender beef, rice noodles, and fresh herbs wrapped in a warm flour tortilla.

## Ingredients:

- 8 large flour tortillas
- 4 oz thin rice noodles, cooked and drained
- 1 lb thinly sliced beef sirloin
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups beef or vegetable broth
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 cup bean sprouts
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped
- 1/4 cup green onions, chopped
- 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced (optional)
- 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
- 1/4 cup sriracha sauce

## Instructions:

1. In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until softened.

2. Add the beef or vegetable broth, fish sauce, sugar, and soy sauce to the pot. Bring the broth to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 20 minutes to develop the flavors.

3. While the broth is simmering, heat a pan over medium-high heat. Sear the thinly sliced beef sirloin for 1-2 minutes on each side, just until cooked through. Set aside.

4. Assemble the phoritto: Lay out a large flour tortilla on a clean surface. Place a portion of cooked rice noodles in the center of the tortilla, then top with a portion of the seared beef, a handful of bean sprouts, and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro, basil, mint, and green onions. Add jalapeño slices, if desired.

5. Drizzle hoisin sauce and sriracha sauce over the filling, according to your preference for spiciness. Be careful not to overfill the tortilla, as it may be difficult to wrap.

6. Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll it up tightly from the bottom to enclose the filling. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.

7. To serve, cut the Classic Phoritto in half diagonally and enjoy with extra hoisin and sriracha sauce on the side.

The Classic Phoritto offers the best of both Vietnamese and Mexican cuisines in a single, satisfying meal. Enjoy this tasty fusion dish on-the-go or for a unique and flavorful dinner at home.
